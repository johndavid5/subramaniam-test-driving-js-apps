The basic skeleton for "todo" was created
via express generator:

$ npm install express-generator -g

# For example, the following creates an Express app named myapp.
# The app will be created in a folder named myapp in the current
# working directory and the view engine will be set to Pug:
$ express --view=pug myapp
