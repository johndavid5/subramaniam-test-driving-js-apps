Mantra of TDD: "Red, green, refactor..."

Chapter 4: Tactfully Tackle Dependencies 
Test Doubles: Fakes vs. Stubs vs. Mocks vs. Spies.

1. Fakes: Implementations suitable for testing, but not for production. 
   e.g., Credit card processing services offer two services,
   one for production use and fake for use during testing.

2. Stubs: These are not real implementations but may readily
   return canned responses when called.

3. Mocks: Are like stubs in that they may return canned
   values, however they keep track of interactions...
   they tattletale about interactions and help verify
   communication between the code being tested and its
   dependencies.

4. Spies: Unlike the other three, spies stand as proxies
   in front of the actual dependency.  They may interact
   with the real service while stubbing or mocking out
   some select parts.  These are useful when interaction
   with the actual service during testing is not an issue
   but we still want to verify the interactions or mock
   out select parts...

You'd use stubs to verify state while you'd use mocks
to verify behavior.
